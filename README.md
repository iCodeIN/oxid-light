> Simple functional programming language with refinement types, powered by [Inox](https://github.com/epfl-lara/inox).

Crafted for my *Refine your types!* [talk](https://github.com/romac/talks/tree/master/2018-05-31-RefineYourTypes) at the [*Formal Methods and Verified Software* meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Formal-Methods-and-Verified-software-meetup).

## Disclaimer

This is just a prototype, and should not be taken as a proper basis for implementing a language with refinement types.
